## React Corgi Adoption

A project I made to practice React and fetching from an API.

To install:

- `npm install` --> create node_modules
- `npm start` --> to play locally
- `npm run build` --> to build

Get your own Petfinder API key here: https://www.petfinder.com/developers/api-key

In src/App.js add your API key in both instances of APIKEYHERE
